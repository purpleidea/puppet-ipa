# This is an autogenerated function, ported from the original legacy version.
# It /should work/ as is, but will not have all the benefits of the modern
# function API. You should see the function docs to learn how to add function
# signatures for type safety and to document this function using puppet-strings.

# TODO: is 'flat' the correct topological name for what this algorithm outputs?

#
#		Example:
#
#			$valid_peers = ipa_topology_flat($peers)
#			notice("valid peers is: ${valid_peers}")
#
#		This function is used internally for building automatic topologies.
